Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for Library Management System

1. Introduction

The Library Management System (LMS) is designed to automate the management and administration of a library. This system aims to streamline processes such as book cataloging, circulation, member management, and reporting. The software provides both librarians and users with a user-friendly interface to efficiently manage library resources and services.

2. Functional Requirements

2.1. User Management

Registration: Users (both librarians and members) should be able to register with the system by providing necessary details such as name, email, and password.
Login: Registered users should be able to log in to the system using their credentials.
User Roles: The system should differentiate between librarian and member roles, each with specific privileges and access levels.
2.2. Book Management

Cataloging: Librarians should be able to add new books to the system by entering details such as title, author, ISBN, category, and copies available.
Search: Users should be able to search for books by title, author, category, or ISBN.
Checkout/Return: Members should be able to check out books and return them within the specified due date.
Availability: The system should maintain real-time information about the availability of books and notify users about the availability status.
2.3. Member Management

Profile Management: Members should be able to update their profile information, including contact details and password.
Membership Renewal: The system should support membership renewal and notify members about upcoming renewals.
Fine Management: The system should calculate fines for overdue books and notify members about outstanding fines.
2.4. Reservation and Hold

Reservation: Users should be able to reserve books that are currently unavailable.
Hold: Users should be able to place books on hold and receive notifications when the books become available.
2.5. Reporting and Analytics

Book Reports: Librarians should be able to generate reports on book circulation, popular titles, overdue books, etc.
User Reports: Generate reports on member activity, fines, memberships, etc.
Analytics: Provide statistical analysis and insights to optimize library operations and resource allocation.
3. Non-functional Requirements

3.1. Performance

The system should be responsive and able to handle concurrent users efficiently.
Book search and retrieval operations should be fast and accurate.
3.2. Security

User passwords should be securely hashed and stored.
Access to sensitive operations and data should be restricted based on user roles.
3.3. Scalability

The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of users, books, and transactions.
3.4. Usability

The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for both librarians and members.
Proper error handling and informative messages should be provided to assist users.
4. System Architecture

The system will be built using a multi-tier architecture:

Presentation Layer: Web-based interface for user interaction.
Application Layer: Business logic and application functionality.
Data Layer: Database for storing user data, book information, transaction history, etc.
5. Technology Stack

Programming Language: Java, Python, or similar
Web Framework: Django, Spring Boot, or similar
Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or similar
Frontend: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript
Additional Tools: RESTful API for communication, Git for version control
6. Conclusion

The Library Management System aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of library operations by automating various tasks and providing robust features for both librarians and members. This SRS outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, system architecture, and technology stack necessary for the successful development and deployment of the system.
